OS Project Idea


if not building something wiht COSMOS:
	understanding how it works and what it does behind the scenes

make something:
	some kind of embedded it?
	I want to try this **** build a docker that allows ~small .NET docker environments (100 MB instead of 5 GB)
	get it to run in a container (DOCKER)
