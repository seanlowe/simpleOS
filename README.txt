if not building something with COSMOS:
	understanding how it works and what it does behind the scenes

make something:
	- some kind of embedded something or another?
	- build a docker that allows ~small .NET docker environments (100 MB instead of 5 GB)
		- I want to try this one.
	- get it to run in a container (DOCKER)
